This repository contains a project name "LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM".

It is made with help of MySQL and programming language C++.
It uses the concept of Database Management System and concept of OOP like classes and member functions.

First create a databse with name of your choice and create these tables with following attributes inside them:-

TABLE BOOKS

![books](https://github.com/sonal-jk/cpp-practise/assets/116245585/e6df3839-008f-4282-b315-ee51c9b7f4df)

TABLE SUPPLIERS

TABLE EMPLOYEE

TABLE MEMBERS

TABLE SALES

After creating all these tables, perform connectivity between your c++ code and your database using mysql.h header file and it's methods.

You are all set to use this code as to your liking.
